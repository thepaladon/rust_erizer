# Angle's Rust_erizer
## Final Screenshot :
Runs with 28ms on my `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz`

## Overview
A CPU Rasterizer written in Rust between Block B and C during Y2 in BUas. 
More info in this file [info.md](https://github.com/thepaladon/rust_erizer/blob/master/docs/info.md)

This personal project served as my introduction to the Rust programming language. I looked into all of the quality-of-life improvements this language supports over C++ like easy CI/CD, formatting, and warning handling (linting). 

I wrote this project as part of a masterclass held at the university. At the end of the masterclass, there was a competition for the most impressive rasterizer. My renderer was chosen and I won a little 3D-printed Ferris The Crab, Rust's mascot.

Thanks to this and previous school projects I was selected to intern at [Traverse Research](https://traverse.nl/) for their "Summer of Code" internship program.

+ Frustum Culling

### Rendering:
+ Multithreaded Fragment Shader
+ Textures
+ Samplers (ClampToEdge, Repeat, Mirror)
+ Clipping and Backface Culling
+ Normals Rendering
+ Vertex Colors

### Render Modes:
_(Switch render modes with M1 and M2)_
+ Basic Lambertian Albedo shading
+ Vertex Color 
+ Albedo
+ Albedo + Vertex Color

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Rust installed.
2. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/thepaladon/rust_erizer`
3. Inside the project directory run: `cargo run -r`

Note: Running the project in `Release (-r)` is a must since the rendering code runs on the CPU.
